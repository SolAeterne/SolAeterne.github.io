The player is placed in a dark room lit by a single spotlight with a table in front of them. Upon the table, there is a stack of paper and an flashing alarm clock with the word “WORK” plastered where there would normally be time. When the player turns the alarm off, the screen fades to black. Moments later the player is greeted with a similar scene to before; however this time, the alarm is larger, louder, and more stacks of paper surround the player. If the process is repeated, the scene progressively becomes more and more unbearable until eventually, the stacks of paper close in on the player consuming them.

                    <p id="content">“Procrastination” was built using the Unity game engine and the virtual reality components derived from the VRTK Virtual Reality Too. The alarm clock itself was created through the use of photogrammetry and done with the software Photoscan. Due to non-optimal photogrammetry conditions, the final alarm clock result was distorted; however with a little touch up of the 3D model in Blender and the texture in Photoshop, the warped clock was fitting for the dream-like experience that this project was going for.
