                    <p class = "lead">“In a 3D video game, could narrative interpretation be changed by altering the techniques used to build the world?”</p>
                    <p>Video games portray their narrative in a unique way compared to other forms of media. This is a result of the fact that video games are something that is meant to be played or interacted with. Meaning the way a video game narrative is understood can be separated by how the game tells a story and how a player plays the story. To properly comprehend this, one must understand the theory behind play. Play theory is something that has a longer history than the lifespan of video games, and many early theorists based their research on recreational activities outside of gaming; however, these theories are still applicable to current day video games and form the basis of countless research on play today. Dutch historian Johan Huizinga compared play to a ritual in his book Homo Ludens a Study of the Play-Element in Culture in the early 1900s, describing that once one plays, they are transported into another world in which “an absolute and peculiar order reigns”(Huizinga 10). These temporary worlds contain their own set of rules in which those within must follow lest they wish to spoil the game. This world that Huizinga refers to as a playground was later expanded upon and given the moniker magic circle by Eric Zimmerman and Katie Salen. The concept of play as explored by play theorist Brian Sutton-Smith is divided into what he calls the seven rhetorics of play. The seven rhetorics, play as progress, fate, power, identity, imaginary, self, and frivolous, are the perspectives of which Sutton-Smith uses to understand play. In his view of play as imaginary, Sutton-Smith examines through the lens of literature how an author uses play to transform a reader by the author’s desire. “These authors use the rhetoric of imaginary because they want us to identify with their perspective” (Sutton-Smith 141). These two explorations on play, while not initially built with video games in mind, embody an approach to world building. The world uses the imaginary to bring about a desired perspective and rule set in order for players to enter Huizinga’s magic circle, and there is an inherent want to not break the rules so that they can continue to play. </p>

                    <p>World building is an important aspect of games. One major facet of world building in games is level design, but how can level design be used to develop the narrative? The article Environmental Storytelling: Creating Immersive 3D Worlds Using Lessons Learned from the Theme Park Industry written by the former Disney imagineer Don Carson, explores the ways designing a theme park can be similar to level design and the creation of a 3D video game environment. Carson describes two major questions the player should know when placed into a world different to our own: “Where am I?” and “What is my relationship to this place?”. Carson believes that if these questions cannot be answered in the first fifteen seconds, than there is an issue with the environment. He goes on to dictate various ways for which the environment can be used to tell a story such as cause and effect, the means of which the passage of time can be shown through action and the subsequent reaction. Another way is to use contrast in world building, such as a change of colour of the size of spaces, to create grander effects on the player, something explored in Excerpts from An Architectural Approach to Level Design By Chris Totten, an article that takes describes the way architectural elements can be applied to level design in video games. Calling to specific examples, Resident Evil constricted their hallways to limit movement and create a claustrophobic environment that made the enemies a bigger threat whereas Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time contrasts a small room prior to a grand expansive room as a way of generating importance towards the larger room and the things within. The concept explores the way a player is supposed to feel in a specific area through the spatial arrangement of the environment which he designates as Genius Loci, also known as the spirit of the place. My thesis revolves around world building, and since world building and level design in video games go hand in hand, taking the ideas that Carson and Totten propose into consideration, level design has great potential in creating a mood and atmosphere that affects the interpretation of a narrative.</p>

                    <p>What are the common ways that games explore narrative? Many games will approach storytelling through conventional means like in game dialogue or through short expositional clips put in between gameplay known as cutscenes. Other games explore the idea that a narrative can be told mostly through the world itself. My thesis pulls focus towards the latter. This genre, coined by the moniker walking simulators, puts focus on the idea of exploration of a world itself over other gameplay mechanics. This term is somewhat derogative as it described this genre as lacking gameplay mechanics other than walking and often subverted the idea of how a game is defined. In Eric Zimmerman and Katie Salen’s Rules of Play, they define a game as something that has a “system”, “something that one or more participants actively play”, “maintain a boundary from so-called "real life" in both time and space” i.e. is artificial, “[embodies] a contest of powers”, states that “rules are a crucial part of games” and that they “have a quantifiable goal or outcome” i.e. winners or losers (Salen and Zimmerman 80). Walking simulators tend to lack conflict and a win/lose state that most people associate with games. As a way to further bring forward the concept of a game world and its potential for affecting narrative, my thesis places itself within this genre of a walking simulator. Thus, there is a great importance in exploring existing works to explore different facets for storytelling within the genre.</p>

                    <p>A notable example is the game Dear Esther, developed by The Chinese Room in 2012. “At the time, it drew a lot of hatred, partly because it was labelled a “videogame” and some viewed its low interactive demands as not being qualified” (Kill Screen Staff). They tend to put a large focus on world building and telling a story within an intricately crafted world for the player to discover and explore. “The exploration becomes a kind of alchemy, turning the most basic forms of interaction and living into golden discovery” (Cross). As the player surveys the island and discovers new sights to see, a voice reads fragments of a letter by a man directed towards his deceased wife. The more the player explores, the more audio fragments are revealed and thus, more of the narrative is explained. Self-described on the game’s Steam store page, the game “[abandons] traditional gameplay for a pure story-driven experience”. This reduced version of a game formula which draws attention to world building and environmental storytelling is the basis of my thesis. In this situation, players are determining a narrative mostly through exploration and discovery. As a result, the world becomes an even larger component of the game. So with this in mind, in theory altering the world design in any way should invariably change something in the narrative. While my thesis investigates exploratory storytelling, it differs in that it will not include dialog; however, Dear Esther is useful reference material in understanding the means for which walking simulators encourage players to explore.</p>

                    <p>Where Dear Esther uses dialogue to communicate the narrative, other games like The Path developed by Tales of Tales do things differently. Inspired by the older versions of the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood, the player controls six sisters who are to go to their grandmother’s house deep in the forest and warned to stay on the path as wolves inhabit the forest. If the player obediently goes to their grandmother’s house, the game ends; however, this is not the way the player is intended to experience the game. Straying from the path the player will find various strange items and eventually meet the wolf. The game is of the walking simulator genre and exhibits storytelling in a non-traditional method where the player is told to do one thing, but expected to do something else. It plays upon the aspect of freedom of exploration in games as the means for which the player interprets the story. Again the story is not explicitly explained to the player but instead, understood through inferring from what the world shows them. My thesis utilises the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as the overarching narrative of the two worlds. Thus, looking at other similar mediums that have adapted the same fairy tale is advantageous in terms of looking for inspiration, especially since The Path is also of the walking simulator genre.</p>

                    <p>World building is a vast subject for my thesis to explore, but one major component is colour and lighting. So what role does colour and lighting play inside games? Within colour theory, this concept of emotional response created through colour is studied heavily. Erik Geslin, Laurent Jégou, and Danny Beaudoin research the effects of hue, saturation, and brightness in different video game images in their article How Color Properties Can Be Used to Elicit Emotions in Video Games. After surveying 31 females and 54 males, they create a general conclusion that there is a link between emotion and environment properties in that “links exist between feelings of joy/sadness and environment properties: brightness, value, saturation, chroma, and lightness”(Geslin et al. 7). On the other hand, a lower saturation and brightness correlates to an increase in the feeling of fear. Using this idea, a creator can influence a viewer’s emotion with a colourful and bright scene to induce a joyous lighthearted feel or a desaturated dark environment to elicit anxiety or panic. With this in mind, the choice of colour and lighting can be used as a way to create tension. The article Dynamic Lighting for Tension in Games by Magy Seif El-Nasr, Simon Niedenthal, Igor Knez, Priya Almeida, and Joseph Zupko explores this aspect of lighting in films and how this could be translated to the medium of games. Film noir for example, is a genre that uses the contrast of saturation and shadow as a way of affecting the viewer’s stress level. Through their discerning certain patterns they observe that; switching from low to high contrast increases projected tension with the opposite releasing tension, going from low to high colour affinity also increases projected tension with the reverse releasing tension, and finally long periods of high contrast or high colour affinity increase projected tension (Seif El-Nasr et al.). They translated these ideas into the world of games to see if the modulation of environmental lighting can be used to portray the urgency and danger of a situation. They created a modification for the game Unreal Tournament 2004 which would change saturation based on the danger. Even though they noticed slight deviations on the effectiveness based upon their testers personal experiences, they determined that they were able to evoke strong emotional response from the dynamic lighting, specifically noting a change in the perceived tension. So taking these into consideration, lighting and colour plays a large role in setting the atmosphere for players, determining the emotional response of joy or fear and creating tense or calm moods for players to react to. Taking this information into consideration, the two worlds created for my thesis take upon two very contrasting styles. One draws inspiration from the film noire genre, employing a strong use of lighting and shadows while also using colour very sparingly. The other appeals more towards the fantasy and fairy tale genre, the scenery splashed with colour and the lighting exuding warmth.</p>

                    <p>An example of a game that uses lighting and colour theory as a tool for strengthening their story is Inside by Playdead, a 2.5D puzzle platforming game with a dark and atmospheric environment. The game uses a largely monochromatic style, uses colour intentionally sparingly, and uses lighting to enhance the effect of the dystopic world they created. The player controls a young boy, wearing a red shirt making him the most colourful character in the game, who for an unknown reason is being hunted. The player finds themselves exploring an eerie locale and uncovering a dark and sinister project involving lifeless zombies, strange experiments, and mind control. Failure often results in disturbing death scenes. The muted colour palette and dark moody lighting is encompassed by equally unnerving sound design in order to build a harrowing and dystopian world. As with my thesis, the game puts a huge emphasis on world building, specifically through their use of colour and lighting. The mostly monochromatic style and muted colour palette mixed with the gloomy atmospheric lighting and strong use of shadows greatly strengthens the gritty themes that the game portrays while also enriching the narrative that it tells. Drawing similarities to the walking simulator genre, at no point does the game directly feed the story to the player. The game has no dialogue and no cutscenes to speak of that explain what or why anything is happening; yet through the exploration of the world, the player begins to piece together the strange plot that Inside depicts. Much like my thesis project, the video game Inside places a major focus on storytelling through the medium of world building and pays close attention on lighting and colour can influence the mind of their player.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to take one narrative and create two very distinct worlds. Each of these two worlds encompass the single narrative without actively altering it in any way, in order to see the effects on perception. The placement of the things within the world stays relatively the same; however, objects within the world may be in one world may be replaced with different objects that are mechanically similar in the other world to keep with the theme.</p>

<p>The story itself is an adaptation of the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood, with the game world separated into locations based upon the story. Little Red leaves her home to deliver some treats to her grandmother. She encounters a wolf who later eats both her and her grandmother but is subsequently saved by a woodcutter. This tale is fairly well known and thus should be easily recognizable; however, take this story and place it into another genre and one might wonder the effects. The genres for the two worlds I have created are fantasy and film noir, chosen due to the stark contrast in their use of colour and lighting, as well as the differences in thematic storytelling, film noir tending to be dark and gritty over fantasy, whereupon adventures of fantastical proportions tend to exist.</p>

<p>Exploration is a major factor in narrative based video games, allowing the player the freedom to move at their own pace and thus letting the player experience and discover the story as they roam the in-game world. The gameplay loop of exploration and discovery puts a spotlight on the interest in video game world building. World building serves as the foundation upon which everything else is built upon. It establishes the basic rules of existence in a world and the reason for being by answering the question of why. In essence, when the player is placed into a world different to our own, they should a basic grasp on how the world works even it seems foreign to them.</p>

<p class = "lead">“’Where am I?’ No matter how well designed your environments are, if your audience cannot answer this question in the first 15 seconds, you are already lost” (Carson 2).</p>

<p>With interactivity in mind, the way a video game narrative is understood can be split into two: the way the game tells the story, and the way the player plays the story. Looking at the theory of play, Dutch historian Johan Huizinga described play as  a type of ritual in his book Homo Ludens a Study of the Play-Element in Culture. Upon playing, people are transported to a temporary world with its own set of rules that must be followed. If not, they spoil the game. This “magic circle” ritual, a term coined later by Eric Zimmerman and Katie Salen. Can be linked to play theorist Brian Sutton-Smith seven rhetorics of play, more specifically, play as imaginary. In literature, authors use play to transform a reader by the author’s desire, molding the reader to identify with their perspective. While these two theories on play were not formed with video games in mind, they embody the approach to world building fundamental to games. </p>

<p>Within world building, theories on colour and lighting are effective means for eliciting specific emotional responses from the viewer. How Color Properties Can Be Used to Elicit Emotions in Video Games by Erik Geslin et al. explored the links between joy and sadness with hue, saturation, and brightness in different video game images. They concluded that bright and colourful environments can induce a joyous lighthearted feel, whereas a desaturated dark scene commonly provokes anxiety or panic within the viewer. Continuing this point, Magy Seif El-Nasr et al. translated lighting techniques from film to the medium of games in their article Dynamic Lighting for Tension in Games. They sought to see if the modulation of environmental lighting had effects on the tension of a situation by attempting to convey urgency and danger with dynamic lights. Even though they noticed slight deviations on the effectiveness based upon their testers personal experiences, they determined that they were able to evoke strong emotional response from the dynamic lighting.</p>

<p>Video games portray their narrative in a unique way compared to other forms of media. This is a result of the fact that video games are something that is meant to be played or interacted with. Meaning the way a video game narrative is understood can be separated by how the game tells a story and how a player plays the story. Many games will approach storytelling through conventional means like in game dialogue or through short expositional clips put in between gameplay known as cutscenes. Other games explore the idea that a narrative can be told mostly through the world itself. This genre, coined by the moniker walking simulators, puts focus on the idea of exploration of a world itself over other gameplay mechanics. This project is one example of such. Since the focus of this project is world building, I decided that many of the core features of games should be stripped away. The player is in a first person perspective and never sees their own character. Gameplay is minimized with only key objectives for progression, putting the aspect of exploration forefront. This reduced version of a game formula which draws attention to world building and environmental storytelling is the basis of the project. In this situation, players are determining a narrative mostly through exploration and discovery. As a result, the world becomes an even larger component of the game. So with this in mind, in theory any change that happens to the narrative should be a result of a world design alteration.</p>
