                from the Theme Park Industry.” Gamasutra, 1 Mar. 2000, www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131594/environmental_storytelling_.php.
            </p>
            <p>The article Environmental Storytelling: Creating Immersive 3D Worlds Using Lessons Learned from the Theme Park Industry written by the former Disney imagineer Don Carson, explores the ways designing a theme park can be similar to level design and the creation of a 3D video game environment. Using the experience Carson gained designing Disney theme parks, he noticed that both theme parks and the gaming industry created worlds that used the space to entertain their viewers. Circling around the point of environmental storytelling, Carson explains that when designing an environment, the story elements should be ingrained within the spaces that the people walk through. Every person has preconceived ideas and beliefs resulting from their personal experience and their exposure to the world and media. Creators take these expectations and manipulate them in order to design a world that enhances storytelling and entertains its guests. When designing a world, the rules of how the universe works needs to be established. This is integral towards keeping the player or viewer immersed. At the same time, upon entering the world they must know the answer to the questions: “Where am I?” and “What is my relationship to this place?”. Carson believes that if these questions cannot be answered in the first fifteen seconds, than there is an issue with the environment. A way for which the answer can be more easily found is through using familiar designs to help anchor the player to the world. He goes on to dictate various ways for which the environment can be used to tell a story such as cause and effect, the means of which the passage of time can be shown through action and the subsequent reaction. Another way is to use contrast in world building, such as a change of colour of the size of spaces, to create grander effects on the player. The article investigates the concept that, like theme parks, 3D video game environments can be used to tell a story. With the fact that my thesis explores altering narrative with world building, Carson’s exploration into environmental storytelling, i.e. telling a story with the environment, is a promising avenue of research to explore. Carson’s article explores many useful techniques towards creating an environment that communicates a narrative that can be adapted to fit my thesis project.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The journal article How Color Properties Can Be Used to Elicit Emotions in Video Games by Erik Geslin, Laurent Jégou, and Danny Beaudoin is a research piece that is explores the way hue, saturation, and brightness in video game images can correlate to the emotions of those who view them. In order to test this Geslin et al. polled a total of 31 females and 54 males while they viewed a total of 24 different video games stills. Each image had varying levels of brightness and saturation as well as colour variance. The participants were shown a series of images for which they would rate their experience using a long questionnaire. The questionnaire asked the viewers to rate the emotions derived from the images on various scales such as: the happy vs unhappy scale, the excited vs calm scale, and the controlled vs in-controlled scale. They note that their research does not take into account the personal experience of those surveyed and as a result has some margin for error. With this in mind, they determined that in video game environments with less saturation and negative valence tend to result in a feeling of fear, whereas more saturation indicates to the opposite. Likewise the different levels of brightness have corresponding effects. “Lower brightness induces a sense of fear, while high brightness seems to make players have more confidence”. This research correlates to common colour theory understandings but centres its attention on colour theory within video games. Colour theory and lighting are world building tools that play a huge role in determining the mood and atmosphere of a piece and thus, are a good means for affecting the way a player interprets a narrative. By eliciting specific emotional responses from players using these theories on colour in games, it is possible that an artificially tense environment can construe a narrative understanding differently than a tranquil environment with less perceived stress. My thesis explores changing narrative through world building techniques and arguably, colour plays a fundamental role. Looking at the test results of Geslin et al. my thesis can create colour palettes that correspond to the mood that each world needs to portray. By having a palette for each world that highly differs in terms of intended emotional response, the thesis explores if the change can affect perceived narrative.</p>
            <p class = "lead">Harvey, Auriea, and Michaël Samyn. The Path. Tales of Tales, 2009.</p>
            <p>Developed by Tales of Tales in 2009, The Path is a psychological horror exploration game that is inspired by the older versions of the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood but set in the modern day. The player controls six sisters who, one by one, are sent by their mother on an errand to visit their sick and bedridden grandmother. They are ordered to go directly to their grandmother’s house deep in the forest and warned to stay on the path and never stray, as wolves inhabit the forest. If the player obediently goes to their grandmother’s house, the game ends and the same girl that was chosen can be played again; however, this is not the way the player is intended to experience the game. Straying from the path the player will find various strange items and eventually meet the wolf. Depending on which girl the player is controlling, the wolf takes on a different form and will lead the girl astray and after a brief cutscene the screen fades to black. The girl reawakens  on the path and limps to grandmother’s house where she is greeted, not by grandmother, but a grisly scene with implications on the fate of the girl. The game is of the walking simulator genre and exhibits storytelling in a non-traditional method where the player is told to do one thing, but expected to do something else. It plays upon the aspect of freedom of exploration in games as the means for which the player interprets the story. Again the story is not explicitly explained to the player but instead, understood through inferring from what the world shows them. My thesis utilises the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as the overarching narrative of the two worlds. Thus, looking at other similar mediums that have adapted the same fairy tale is advantageous in terms of looking for inspiration, especially since The Path is also of the walking simulator genre. While the majority of The Path is in the third person perspective. Upon reaching the grandmother’s home, the camera switches to first person like my thesis. This section is worthwhile to look at in terms of methods for using the first person camera in a world building sense. </p>

            <p>Inside by Playdead is a 2.5D puzzle platforming game with a dark and atmospheric environment. The game uses a largely monochromatic style, uses colour intentionally sparingly, and uses lighting to enhance the effect of the dystopic world they created. The player controls a young boy, wearing a red shirt making him the most colourful character in the game, who for an unknown reason is being hunted. Traversing the world from left to right and completing various puzzles, the player finds themselves exploring an eerie locale and uncovering a dark and sinister project involving lifeless zombies, strange experiments, and mind control. Failure often results in disturbing death scenes, much like the game’s predecessor Limbo. The muted colour palette and dark moody lighting is encompassed by equally unnerving sound design in order to build a harrowing and dystopian world. As with my thesis, the game puts a huge emphasis on world building, specifically through their use of colour and lighting. The mostly monochromatic style and muted colour palette mixed with the gloomy atmospheric lighting and strong use of shadows greatly strengthens the gritty themes that the game portrays while also enriching the narrative that it tells; however, at no point does the game directly feed the story to the player. The game has no dialogue and no cutscenes to speak of that explain what or why anything is happening; yet through the exploration of the world, the player begins to piece together the strange plot that Inside depicts. The game sports a strange ending and, with the lack of direct explanation, many have created a plethora of theories in an effort to understand the plot of the game. Much like my thesis project, the video game Inside places a major focus on storytelling through the medium of world building and pays close attention on lighting and colour can influence the mind of their player. My thesis takes inspiration from this aspect of no dialog exploratory storytelling since my focus is specifically looking at the effects of world building on narrative. The idea that the world around the player depicts the story rather than directly feeding the plot to the player is the effect that I am exploring. At the same time, the colour and lighting that Inside uses to create a dark and suspenseful atmosphere is very useful visual support. While the piece I create draws more closely with the film noir genre, the mood and feel is similar to that of Inside and the techniques that were used to build the world.</p>

            <p>Sophia Niergarth’s project Carried is a research project that centres on the understanding of a virtual space. The project itself is a first person 3D experimental exploration based video game paired with a thesis paper where the story focused on escapism and disconnect and told through multiple virtual settings. Using unconventional transitions, the project sought to answer “How would your experience be changed if you suddenly found yourself somewhere new?” Inspired by visual tricks and abstraction of space and reality in animation, Niergarth explored the relationship between perceived reality, the camera, and the connections between as a means of storytelling in a video game. She concluded her research by stating that player camera control plays a major role in the employable types of visual tricks. Due to a player’s reliance on special queues, disorientation carries quite an impact. At the same time, players will accept breaks in reality so long as they happen in their field of vision rather than outside. In essence, the story needed to reflect the spatial way that she was trying to tell it and vice versa. This project exemplifies a very interesting method of storytelling in games. Like my thesis, it explores world building in video games; however, it pulls focus towards the use of camera and transitions to affect perceived reality. While this project has less of a pull towards story, it has very clear themes of surrealism. The piece has a “loose story structured around ideas of isolation, loneliness and fear of the unknown. The character goes from homesickness to curiosity to fear, and finally to empowerment.” Stylistically, Sophia Niergath’s work is comparable to the style that I seek to achieve in my thesis and she explores similar aspects of interpretation, control, and world building that are being explored that I too am investigating. </p>

            <p>Dear Esther was developed by The Chinese Room, originally as a modification for the Source game engine, and was commercially released in 2012. The game is a first-person exploration video game with minimal gameplay mechanics. The player explores a remote island somewhere in outer Hebrides that is completely uninhabited. As the player surveys the island and discovers new sights to see, a voice reads fragments of a letter by a man directed towards his deceased wife. The more the player explores, the more audio fragments are revealed and thus, more of the narrative is explained. Self-described on the game’s Steam store page, the game “[abandons] traditional gameplay for a pure story-driven experience”. Dear Esther lacks the commonalities that standard game theories have when defining what a game is. There is no conflict, no win or lose state, and no gameplay mechanics barring basic movement. As a result, this game was given the slightly derogative moniker “walking simulator” due to the lack of gameplay and the way it subverted standard game definition. They are also frequently referred to as art games or notgames. While looked down upon due to their lack of interactivity, walking simulators will often put a large focus on world building and telling a story within a world that is meant for the player to discover and explore. With the way that this genre of games strip away portions of the formula for a game, it draws more attention towards the aspect of world building and environmental storytelling as the basis of the game. The thesis project that I am creating is for all intents and purposes of the walking simulator genre like Dear Esther. Thus, it is important to explore the way games of this genre approach telling narrative to their audience. Dear Esther is an experience that enforces discovery through exploration while also feeding the player fragments of a story in order to let players create their own interpretations of the video game’s plot. This means of storytelling is an interesting avenue to explore where a voiceless protagonist who explores the scenery and is given further context by voices directed to them. While my thesis investigates exploratory storytelling, it differs in that it will not include dialog; however, Dear Esther is useful reference material in understanding the means for which walking simulators encourage players to explore.</p>

            <p>Alongside colour theory, lighting plays a major role in creating emotional responses from viewers. Dynamic Lighting for Tension in Games by Magy Seif El-Nasr, Simon Niedenthal, Igor Knez, Priya Almeida, and Joseph Zupko analyzes lighting in games and the emotional response from this style, specifically through the effects of illumination relating to emotion and tension. They note that game developers often borrow cinematic and animation lighting techniques for the spaces that they create and thus, exploring those techniques help with understanding emotional response from lighting. Observing the cinematic lighting techniques of various films of numerous genres such as horror and drama, Seif El-Nasr et al. explored the ways they evoke tension through lighting and took their conclusions to the gaming world. Film noir is an example of a genre that uses monochromatic colour palettes with the contrast of saturation and shadow to affect the viewer’s stress levels. Films like The Shining use a contrast between warm and cold lighting during peak moments of stress to greatly enhance tension whereas the film Citizen Kane explores the change of brightness. Based on the patterns found from their research they categorized the effects as follows: switching from low to high contrast increases projected tension with the opposite releasing tension, going from low to high colour affinity also increases projected tension with the reverse releasing tension, and finally long periods of high contrast or high colour affinity increase projected tension. Taking these conclusions to the world of games, they created a situation where dynamic environmental lighting and change of saturation was used to indicate the urgency and danger of a situation. While the results varied based upon the user’s personal experience they determined that emotional response can be evoked using dynamic lighting and much like colour theory, can play a powerful role in setting the atmosphere for the players. My thesis takes this research and explores whether the contrasting lighting and as a result, contrasting emotions can affect the way a player interprets a narrative. Using lighting as a means of manipulating emotion, narrative interpretation can be addressed through artificially creating feelings that change the understanding of a situation. My thesis can use lighting in contrasting ways, with one location prompting a tense environment and the other having a calming effect, my thesis uses this research to explore world building from a lighting perspective.</p>

            <p>Excerpts from An Architectural Approach to Level Design By Chris Totten is an article that takes important excerpts from his novel An Architectural Approach to Level Design that show the way architectural elements can be applied to level design in video games. While the novel itself is a good read for understanding the relationship between architecture and games, this article is much more concise in terms of getting a good understanding of the concept. The article focuses on the main points from three chapters: Ways of Seeing for Level Design, Level Design Workflows, and Architectural Spatial Arrangements. In chapter one, Totten takes the ten ways to explore and understand a building from Think Like and Architect by Hal Box and reinterprets them to fit level design in video games. The second chapter explores the workflow of level design and how game mechanics influence the design. Team Fortress 2 expanded some of their hallways as a way to better circulate the players and the objective. On the other hand, Resident Evil constricted their hallways to limit movement and create a claustrophobic environment that made the enemies a bigger threat. Continuing from this idea, the next chapter focuses on the idea of Genius Loci, also known as the spirit of the place. The concept explores the way a player is supposed to feel in a specific area through the spatial arrangement of the environment. Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time contrasts a small room prior to a grand expansive room as a way of generating importance towards the larger room and the things within. Genius Loci can also be changed by lighting, colour, and the aforementioned use of space. My thesis revolves around world building, and since world building and level design in video games go hand in hand, taking the ideas that Totten proposes into consideration, level design has great potential in creating a mood and atmosphere that affects the interpretation of a narrative.</p>
